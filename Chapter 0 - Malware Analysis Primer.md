## Chapter 0 - Malware Analysis Primer
### Malware analysis goals:

**1. Identify**
- Provide information you need to **respond** to a network intrusion\
- Determine **what** happened
- Locate all infected machines and files

**2. Develop signatures to detect infections**
- **Host-based signatures** - detect malicious code on victims e.g. identify what files are created or modified. Unlike AV signatures, malware indicators focus on what the malware does to a system, not on the characteristics of malware itself
- **Network signatures** - detect malicious code by monitoring network traffic.

**3. Figure how the malware works**
- Often questions by senior management
- Explanation of major intrusio

### Types of Malware Analysis

| types | description | benefits | difficulty |  
| -- | -- | -- | -- | 
| basic static analysis | Examine the executable without viewing actual instructions. Just to confirm if file is malicious, provide info about its functionality. | Pros: Quick <br> Cons: largely ineffective against sophisticated malware. Can miss important behaviors | Easy | 
| basic dynamic anlysis | Running malware and observing behavior. | Pros: Can capture effective signatures. Observe behavior. Can be used by most people without deep programming knowledge. <br> Cons: May cause damage if not run in an isolated or properly setup environment. Not effective with all malware, may miss important functionality. | Medium | 
| advanced static analysis | Reverse-engineering by looking at program via disassembler. | Pros: Clarity of malware functionality <br> Cons: Super difficult, require a steeper learning curve than basic analysis methods. | Very Difficult |
| advanced dynamic analysis | Uses debugger to examine internal state of running malicious executable | Pros: Provides other way to extract detailed information. <br> Alternative method when it is difficult to gather information using typically used methods. <br> Cons: Hmm, Not sure yet! Let's find out! | Difficult | 

### Types of Malware
Most malware falls into these category, but may not be limited to the following. Disclaimer, added the description by my own words that helps me understand (if you disagree and call me blasphemy for not using the right terms, forgive me!) 

| malware | description | 
| -- | -- | 
| Backdoor | Lets you in remotely |
| Botnet | Turns your machine into little 'minions' that the master (C2 server) can call upon to do terrible things (run malicious payloads) |
| Downloader | Downloads additional maliciouos stuff. Malware probably travels 'light' but gets the bulk of the malicious code after infecting |
| Information-stealing malware | Sniffers, keyloogers, password hash grabbers. |
| Launcher | More stealthy. Malicious program launches other malicious programs |
| Rootkit | Mainly to hide the existence of malicious code. Typically pair with backdoor to allow remote access to attackers |
| Scareware | Sell fear. Eg. install this software now to remove a virus! when infact the recommended software is infact the malware |
| Spam-sending malware | Revenue generating for attackers. Can turn victim machines for sending spams, in turn sell spam-sending services |
| Worm or virus | Malicious code that **can copy itself and infect others** | 
| Ransomware | (this wasnt mentioned? hmm..) No good outcomes, you lose money and/or all your affected files gone without gaurantees even if you paid!) | 


### Tips for beginners 
Given by the authors:

1. **Focus on the key features** - Dont get too caught up in details! Most malware too complex and unlikely for us to understand every detail. 
2. **Look from different angles** - There is no one approach. Try analyzing from dfiferent angles, with different tools and techniques. Don't spend too long on any one issue.
3. **Respond to changes** to ever changing analysis techniques. Seek to recognize, understand and defeat (Improve?) on ever changing and new analysis techniques
